    "- **Option 1 – Display the image**\n",
    "  - Shows the current `image_array` using `matplotlib.pyplot.imshow`.\n",
    "  - If the image has colour, it shows it in colour. If it is 2D (grayscale), it uses a gray colour map.\n",

    "  - This turns it into a **single-channel** image (black and white).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 3 – Blur the image**\n",
    "  - Asks you for a **blur strength** from 1 to 10.\n",
    "  - Builds a **Gaussian blur kernel** using `helpers.gaussian_kernel`.\n",
    "  - Uses `helpers.apply_gaussian_blur` to smooth the image.\n",
    "  - Larger strength → bigger blur.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 4 – Edge detection**\n",
    "  - Makes sure the image is grayscale.\n",
    "  - Uses **OpenCV Sobel filters** (`cv2.Sobel`) to find edges in x and y directions.\n",
    "  - Combines them into an **edge magnitude** image and normalizes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 5 – Sharpen the image**\n",
    "  - Makes sure the values are in a good range (0–255).\n",
    "  - Calls `helpers.sharpen_image` to apply a sharpening kernel.\n",
    "  - This makes edges and details more visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 6 – Fix bad lighting (histogram equalisation)**\n",
    "  - Calls `helpers.histogram_equalisation(image_array)`.\n",
    "  - For grayscale: spreads out the brightness values so the image is clearer.\n",
    "  - For colour: equalises the brightness channel in a colour space (LAB) so the result still looks natural.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 7 – Save Image**\n",
    "  - Converts the image to `uint8` (0–255 integer pixels) using `helpers.to_uint8`.\n",
    "  - Asks you for a file name.\n",
    "  - Makes sure a `saves` folder exists using `os.makedirs`.\n",
    "  - Uses `cv2.imwrite` to write the image to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 8 – Reset Image**\n",
    "  - Reloads the image from `image_path`.\n",
    "  - This undoes all changes and restores the last loaded file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 9 – Import Image**\n",
    "  - Asks you to type a path to a new image file.\n",
    "  - Checks that the file exists with `os.path.isfile`.\n",
    "  - Loads it with `img.imread` and updates `image_path` and `image_array`.\n",
